{-
    Quicksort in Haskell.

    It is incredibly impressive to me that quicksort can be so naturally
    implemented when expressed in a functional language.

    Unfortunately, it loses some points for not being an in-place sort.

quicksort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
quicksort [] = []
quicksort (p:xs) = (quicksort smaller) ++ [p] ++ (quicksort bigger)
    where smaller = filter (<= p) xs
          bigger = filter (> p) xs 

main = print $ quicksort [1,2,5,3,1,56,3,2]

        DIY Operators

Haskell allows the user to define infix operators by hand.

Operator names are built from 
    ! # $ % & * + . / < = > ? \ ^ | : - ~

x ^^^ y = (x*y)^(x+y)
